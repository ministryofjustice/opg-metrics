# About this service

## Mission Statement

OPG has many 'things' to measure to aid in decision making, but these are not visible to all or easily accessible in one place, making it difficult to see patterns and connections, or high level problems across products.

## Problems this service aims to solve

* A common language that can be used across teams and OPG.
* Encourage and Gamify the culture of celebrating maintenance and managing legacy
* Understanding our users over time
* Hold ourselves accountable throughout the entire service life-cycle
* Think about performance and monitoring at the start and what done/good looks like
* Reduce barriers to entry for getting data

## How should you use this service

This service is not intended to be a place where you debug issues or store logs that you can diagnose problems. It is to enable you to pass key bits of information across multiple services so you can overlay data points, find patterns and maintain visibility of your service.

If you do find something happening you should use other tools that are built for this in mind to dig deeper into the issue.
