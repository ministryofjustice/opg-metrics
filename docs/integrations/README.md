## Plugins and integrations

As the service can take data from a [REST endpoint](/docs/openapi/README.md), it makes it easy for you to integrate external services. An example of a few services that could be used are below.

As well as the REST endpoint you can also take advantage of the [AWS Kinesis Stream](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) to pass data into the system or go straight to the [AWS Timestream Database](https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/).

Below are a list of existing integrations that have been done and can be used with the service. Should you wish to add your own to the list, please raise a PR with a link and description.
